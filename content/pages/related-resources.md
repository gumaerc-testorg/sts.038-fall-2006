Guide to Buying Books Online
----------------------------

The list below includes some of the Web sites I consult when shopping for books online. Some offer new books at reduced prices, others used books, others "remaindered" books—new books returned from other bookstores. It's worth shopping around!

{{% resource_link "b4f1ddf4-27be-4701-996c-c6ab5be0e3e6" "Amazon®" %}} - The trusty standard. Has both new and also used books.

{{% resource_link "b81d4e15-5b92-4e11-aad9-d2c2f097f7f8" "AddALL®" %}} - Searches dozens of used book store inventories and compares the prices.

{{% resource_link "b1a8515a-51fc-4985-b155-85f70ae07dd9" "AbeBooks®" %}} - Similarly compares used book stores. Has some overlap with Addall, but sometimes better for rarer or out of print books.

{{% resource_link "f5a94569-87dc-4fb6-93d5-778f02d3335a" "half.com®" %}} - This is an ebay® site, but it doesn't have the auction component. Sellers are often just people with books to get rid of, not bookstores.

There are many others. This is a start. Enjoy!
