Guide to Buying Books Online
----------------------------

The list below includes some of the Web sites I consult when shopping for books online. Some offer new books at reduced prices, others used books, others "remaindered" books—new books returned from other bookstores. It's worth shopping around!

{{% resource_link "9be886f4-aaab-44c6-8279-5d33106658b6" "Amazon®" %}} - The trusty standard. Has both new and also used books.

{{% resource_link "7058b8ca-0e81-4ee5-94fc-53797c37ed99" "AddALL®" %}} - Searches dozens of used book store inventories and compares the prices.

{{% resource_link "82b830e8-bbc8-4f8f-900f-c6a2e1f60d45" "AbeBooks®" %}} - Similarly compares used book stores. Has some overlap with Addall, but sometimes better for rarer or out of print books.

{{% resource_link "32b481ae-3a34-4d43-b1a4-3378f815984c" "half.com®" %}} - This is an ebay® site, but it doesn't have the auction component. Sellers are often just people with books to get rid of, not bookstores.

There are many others. This is a start. Enjoy!
